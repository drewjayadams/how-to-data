## Welcome to working with data!

Welcome to GitHub - I expect some of the people reading this are unfamiliar with GitHub. It's a tool for managing code and other computer files. Think of it like Google Drive for programmers (with more features that are useful to nerds). 

I use this repository (think of it like a folder) to manage sharing files when I do data workshops. Looking for stuff from one of those? Try these links:

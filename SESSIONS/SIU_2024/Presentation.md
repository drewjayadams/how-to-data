# A (very) brief guide on working with data

## Who are you? 
My name is Andrew Adams. I'm a reporter and longtime nerd. I have won awards for my (reporting on  PPP loans in Effingham)[https://www.effinghamdailynews.com/more-than-73-5-million-in-federal-loans-help-local-companies----and/article_7094f296-100b-11eb-ad55-3b60700d3bb9.html], I have worked as a data journalist covering the (government tech industry)[https://www.govtech.com/andrew-adams] nationally and currently work as a journalist at (Capitol News Illinois)[https://capitolnewsillinois.com/about-us/andrew-adams]. There, I blend data, visual storytelling and traditional reporting to tell stories about state government. I have a Master's degree from UIS and an undergaduate degree from Illinois Tech. 

## What's on the agenda? 
The purpose of today's session is help you learn about how to work with data without needing to code. We'll talk a bit about data journalism's history, where to find data and how to work with it. 

## Data journalism is a _practice_
Data journalism takes elements from data science, computer science, social science and traditional reporting and blends them. There isn't an academic consensus on what it is because it is a professional practice. I'll share with you elements of my practice based on my own experience as well as tips I've gathered from other (professionals)[https://learn.ire.org/] and (organizations)[https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/two]. 

## Why should you use data? 
+ Data makes it easier to tell different types of stories because fewer people are crawling through data data sets than are reading press releases and going to big events. 
+ Data makes it easier to make sotries more relevant to your audience because it can help localize broad trends or identify communities most in need of the kinds of storytelling we do. 
+ Data can make stories more interactive by allowing readers to examine the facts themelves in a more direct way than if you simply presented quotes and statistics to them.

## What is data?
Data is _structured_ information. The structure is what makes data useful. you can have lots of numbers, but if it's not structured in a way that is useful, then it doesn't do as much good. Typically, data is structured using a digital file format that allows for machines (read: computers) to read and manipulate the information. This is commonly a spreadsheet, like a .xclx Excel format or the more basic comma seperate values format, or .csv. Other useful formats are .json, which is often used for sharing data over the internet; .mdb and .accdb files, which are used for database management; and structures that aren't stored in files but used dynamically in programs, like dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets and more. 

## How to work with data
There are two basic frameworks you can think of when working with data (although an effectively infinite number exist). They are analogous to 
+ Ask a question --> Find a source
+ Have a subject --> explore curiously 

But remember:

## Data journalism is your friend
The goal here is to demistify data and make it easier for all of you to use it in your coverage. Here are the materials for a two-day workshop on how to use the tools of data journalism to cover Illinois state government. 

+ There are two slide decks used forthis. They're pretty bare bones but here is a link to the [first day's](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uAdTI1Kwdqg0X0qopOoL2wviORbVMW1y5r5MnkI7XgI/edit?usp=sharing) and the [second day's](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/108Xs5fUYyMme8kKrt8qO1wxzO2H4mMhgEEJS3VCiUnY/edit?usp=sharing)

+ Here's links to the sample data we'll be using. **Important:** Be sure to go to "File" --> "Make a copy" for each of them so you can actually maniuplate the files.

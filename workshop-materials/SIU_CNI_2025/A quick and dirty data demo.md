## Let's do some math

The goal is to get you brushed up on some data basics and then get you familiarized (or re-familiarized) with Sheets, Datawrapper and Flourish. 

+ Here's a [the slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1339TodOED92HWZyj1mGHlVYS8iQUawgOGCAQjBDgNf4/edit?usp=sharing) that goes with this session.
+ Here's a ["handout" style version](Presentation.md) of that. 
+ Here's a link to [some sample data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZtWVwPkgMPKtxwbW2N7jch3UxODuvV2BymARbjKRZ4/edit?usp=sharing) that we'll use.
  + Be sure to go to "File" --> "Make a copy" 
+ Here are some guides that you can reference later:
  + A guide for [using Sheets](https://github.com/drewjayadams/how-to-data/blob/main/guides/Sheets_101.md)
  + A guide for [choosing a visualization](https://github.com/drewjayadams/how-to-data/blob/main/guides/Vizualizing_101.md)
  + A guide for [helpful data resources](https://github.com/drewjayadams/how-to-data/blob/main/guides/Resources.md)

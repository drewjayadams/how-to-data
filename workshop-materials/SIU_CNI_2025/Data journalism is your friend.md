## Hello!
This is meant to be a quick and dirty guide to working with data as a journlaist.

The goal is to get you brushed up on some data basics and then get you familiarized (or re-familiarized) with Sheets, Datawrapper and Flourish. 

+ Here's a [the slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vNzgiLpKXFEUjdFqwEpLRqzsRJBhKbIe0Z910XUb4wE/edit?usp=sharing) that goes with this session.
+ Here's a ["handout" style version](Presentation.md) of that. 
+ Here's a link to [some sample data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZtWVwPkgMPKtxwbW2N7jch3UxODuvV2BymARbjKRZ4/edit?usp=sharing) that we'll use.
  + Be sure to go to "File" --> "Make a copy" 
+ Here's a [resource guide](Resources.md) that you can reference whenever you'd please.
